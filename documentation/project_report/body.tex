\section{Abstract}
% This needs to be updated to have what we actually delivered

\noindent This project will build a system to process and forecast domain-agnostic live spatio-temporal data over a large geographical region while maintaining reliability and constant up-time.
The main objective is not to produce novel forecasting results, but rather to support and enable a performant large-scale system.
There will be limited traditional programming in Turing complete languages and a more significant focus on declarative programming using open-source DevOps tools.
The general architecture will follow classic "cloud-native" and "microservice" architecture principles to enable scaling and maintainability.
We will configure a CI/CD system that enables new features to be developed and released without system downtime.
To support forecasting, we maintain a simple data pipeline with live data monitoring into a time-series database focusing on fault tolerance.
For forecasting, we will utilize kriging to fill in spare geographical data, which enables better and more consistent forecasting.
We will employ the use of existing visualization and monitoring tools to display the results of kriging.
Additionally, we will utilize a data pipeline monitoring system to track failures and up-time.
