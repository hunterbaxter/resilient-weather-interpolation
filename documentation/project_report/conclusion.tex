\section{Conclusion}
% 1-2 sentences summarizing abstract in a positive light
To conclude, our project delivered a sophisticated data pipeline and visualization system that further refined knowledge of technologies learned in class, and added some additional.
% limitations
The main limitation of the project was the overlapping timelines of Programming Assignment 4 and the final project.
An additional limitation was limited access to historical weather data in the free-tier plan from weatherbit. 
As a result, we pivoted our wishful kriging model, which required historical data,
to a simpler interpolation model that did not require historical data.
% future work lol
The goal of this project was to strengthen and expand our developer tool kits. 
As a result, the project has served its purpose, and their are not any future work possibilities.
% NOTE: should we include a github link, or just do a large zip file?
