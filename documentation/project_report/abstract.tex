\section{Abstract}
This focus of the project is to design a system that visualized live weather data with an emphasis on reliable and scalable design. 
During the project, the authors adhered to DevOps principles, a modern incarnation of Agile Software engineering, as a practice for careers in the technology industry.
The project does not offer any novel answers to any unsolved problems, but rather uses industry grade tools in creating a system that solves an old problem well.
