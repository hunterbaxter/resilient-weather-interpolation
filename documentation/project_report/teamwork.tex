\section{Teamwork}
\subsection{Collaborative Development}
We used Github as our git remote host provider. % imagine if we said we emailed code or used microsoft office lmao
Github is where we stored all of our documenation and source code. 
For collaborating on documents (project proposal, project presentation, project report), we used Overleaf, as we wanted everything to be stored as code, even our reports.
When doing remote pair programming or team meetings, we used Zoom.

\subsection{Work Distribution}
Throughout the course of the project, due to different interests and strengths, two teams formed: 'backend' and 'frontend'.
Broadly, Hunter Baxter and Meghan Callandriello were on the 'backend' team, and Jaden Hicks and Martin Pena were on the 'frontend' team.
