\section{Challenges}
The main challenge was the overlapping timelines of Programming Assignment 4 and the final project. 
An additional challenge was that weather data vendors had significantly fewer features than initially anticipated,
thus historical data availability was cost-prohibitive.
As a result, we pivoted our initial kriging model, which required historical data,
to a simpler interpolation model that did not require historical data.
A sophisticated kriging model is still supported. We abstracted the interpolation model to the rest of the system so that the system is agnostic of the specific choice of the interpolation model.
