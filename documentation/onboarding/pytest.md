# Pytest

Pytest is a testing framework for python that simplifies unit testing, and adds a lot of features.

To install pytest, do:

```
pip intall -U pytest
```

To run pytest, do:

```
pytest
```

To run pytest with code coverage, do:

```
pytest --cov
```

If one does not have pytest on the system path (like through a virtual environment), one will have to do:

```
python3 -m pytest
```
